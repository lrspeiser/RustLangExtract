You are extracting legal entities with exact source spans.

Task:
- Extract only these classes: legal_term, clause, governing_law, notice_address.
- For each entity:
  - extraction_text: exact substring from the text
  - start_char/end_char: 0-based indices relative to this chunk
  - attributes: include type (e.g., confidentiality, termination), jurisdiction, address fields as applicable.

Constraints:
- No paraphrasing; no overlapping entities.
- Return only fields allowed by the schema.
