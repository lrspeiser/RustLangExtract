You are extracting clinical entities with exact source spans.

Task:
- Extract only these classes: medication, icd10_code.
- For each entity:
  - extraction_text: exact substring from the text
  - start_char/end_char: 0-based indices relative to this chunk
  - attributes:
    - For medication: {name, dose, route, frequency}
    - For icd10_code: {code, description}

Constraints:
- No paraphrasing; no overlapping entities.
- Return only fields allowed by the schema.
